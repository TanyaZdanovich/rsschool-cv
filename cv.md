 # Tanya Zdanovich
(Aspiring front-end developer)

## **About me:**
I am responsible, sociable and I have well-developed communication skills. I work well in a team and on individual projects. I really like to study and learn new things and use new information in my projects and assignments.
Opportunity to make something new from scratch is the thing that I like the most about web development. You only need a laptop and your brain to find new solutions to problems.
